# SATRE Control Alignment

The [SATRE Centric Control Alignment Table for Trusted Research Environments](https://zenodo.org/records/16837077) supports SATRE compliance efficiently and transparently.
It provides links between SATRE requirements and controls in other relevant frameworks: ISO 27001, Data Security and Protection Toolkit, and Digital Economy Act.

## Why SATRE Control Alignment Matters

Running a TRE involves navigating multiple frameworks, legislation, and guidance.
The control alignment reference helps you to:

- See where TRE controls overlap across frameworks, and which SATRE controls are aligned with existing ISO, DSP Toolkit, SDE, DEA controls
- Understand which areas are already addressed by other standards
- Identify gaps specifically against SATRE

It should act as a guidance tool, helping TRE operators and developers quickly reference where best practices from other frameworks contribute to SATRE capabilities.
Think of it as a map for SATRE compliance: it highlights connections between standards, shows where existing practices are already contributing, and points out where further work is needed without making assumptions about compliance with other frameworks.

This reference is for guidance only. It benchmarks SATRE control alignment and does not imply compliance with ISO 27001, DSP Toolkit, or DEA. Each framework still requires separate assessment.
