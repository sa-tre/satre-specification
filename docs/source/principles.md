# Architectural Principles

Architectural principles influence and shape the way you design and deliver a SATRE-aligned TRE.
They are a set of guiding considerations that sit above any specific architectural requirement, and can be applied across the entire architecture.

They consist of the following parts:
:Statement: A singular sentence that summarises the principle
:Rationale: Justification as to why this principle is important for the specification
:Implications: Things you need to consider or do to practise this principle

(principle_usability)=

## Principle 1 - Usability

### Statement

A TRE instance that works for all users minimises barriers to use, and provides a productive and accessible analysis environment for research.

### Rationale

There is often a trade-off between increased operational security and the usability of a TRE.
In order to maintain productivity, a TRE must balance these two competing aims.
The design and configuration of a TRE should allow all individuals involved with a TRE to effectively fulfil their roles.

### Implications

- Robust TRE design and implementation should start by understanding users' diverse expectations, needs, existing skillsets and preferences and responsibilities.
- Design, configuration and testing of TREs must recognise a diversity of users.
  For instance, not all users are researchers and not all researchers are users.
  Other users include TRE operators, information governance officers, and TRE builders/developers.
- Because of diverse user needs, it is unlikely that a specific TRE instance will perfectly match the needs of all users.
- A TRE that is overly strict on tool and software provision may risk becoming unusable for users with different and varied backgrounds and skillsets.
- Working environments can differ significantly from users' preferred setups
  This has design and resource implications for supporting new users, and consideration should be given to resources and time required to help users get up to speed with new and unfamiliar TRE instances.
- Improving user experience takes time and resource, and will involve trade-offs between investing time in improved standards, better functional design, improving work and organisational culture, boosting users' skills and knowledge through training and making help more readily available at an organisational level.
  These trade-offs will need to be addressed at an organisational level, and teams may want to consider resourcing staff to focus specifically on these questions, for instance in the positions of product managers or service functions.

(principle_maintaining_trust)=

## Principle 2 - Maintaining public trust

### Statement

TREs holding public data should build and maintain the trust of data subjects and any other impacted individuals, groups, communities and organisations by protecting privacy, keeping data secure and being transparent about their work.

### Rationale

To ensure continued public support both for the use of data and TREs to facilitate research, it is vital to maintain public trust in the ways TREs hold and use data and to alleviate possible concerns.
This could include maintaining the trust of members of the public whose data is held, those who are impacted by research conducted using TREs, and the trust of commercial data providers.

In the case of public sector data, public engagement work has indicated there is support for the use of regulated and ethical TREs working for the public benefit as long as conditions are met surrounding security and transparency.
Consulting impacted parties, including the public, can help ensure TREs are being used for positive, impactful and agreed-upon purposes.
Being transparent about the data held and the projects or organisations who access the data can also help maintain trust.

### Implications

- Being as transparent as possible is key to building trust.
  TREs holding public data should practice transparency. For instance, accreditation from an external body, adherence to a specific design framework (such as the Five Safes), and details of the projects or organisations that access their data should be publicly available information.
  This should be provided in an accessible way.
- In addition to transparency, actively involving members of the public in oversight of TREs and their processes is important for accountability.
  Public involvement and engagement takes time and resources. TREs holding public data should consider allocating specific staffing and budget to public engagement activities.
- Where TREs have consulted impacted parties, they should be auditable by those parties, and consult them as part of any decision making processes.
  This may include the provision of documentation and educational resources for a diverse audience.
- Access to public sector data should be reviewed by an independent panel, which includes members of the public where possible, and follow agreed-upon governance to ensure projects using this data are in the public benefit, and provide clarity around any commercial access.

(principle_observability)=

## Principle 3 - Observability

### Statement

Human initiated and automated processes resulting in change within the TRE should be observable.

### Rationale

System/process observability is key to understanding whether your policies and controls are actually doing what is intended.

It also allows operators to continuously improve their systems and processes, measure their effectiveness, and identify the causes of incidents.
Data can also be made available to other parties such as auditors, data subjects and data providers as part of the assurance process.

This applies to both technical systems and policies/processes.

### Implications

- In order to understand what is happening within the TRE, both automated and human initiated processes should generate sufficient data, for instance through audit logs.
  Any generated data should follow standards for provenance and transparency for audit trails.
- Different levels of observability may be needed for different users.
  Any data collected from an observability perspective should consider the needs of those who will use it, and minimise collection accordingly.
- There may be ethical and confidential issues to consider when implementing the observability principle.

(principle_standardisation)=

## Principle 4 - Standardisation

### Statement

TREs should adhere to standards or well-known patterns wherever possible.

### Rationale

Standardisation makes it easier to design, operate, use and understand TREs, and reduces duplication of work.
This includes making TREs easier to use, deploy, and audit.

TREs should be built in such a way that they do not restrict or prevent interoperability where this may be desirable in future, by identifying and avoiding or removing barriers to interoperability.

Standardisation is also linked to the public trust principle, as a standard approach to TRE provision will make it easier for impacted parties to understand how their data will be used within TREs.

### Implications

- Owing to the broad definition of {term}`TREs <trusted research environment (TRE)>`, there are currently no technical or information governance standards focused on TREs.
  The SATRE specification has therefore been designed to help {ref}`Developers and Operators <infrastructure_roles>` with a variety of technical/policy requirements consider their options
- TRE {ref}`Developers and Operators <infrastructure_roles>` should be prepared identify the technical standards that are appropriate for them to work towards meeting whilst developing or maintaining their particular TRE(s).
- Standards that TREs adhere to may range in scope, including technical, operational and governance requirements.
- TRE {ref}`Developers and Operators <infrastructure_roles>` should ensure that when they aim to meet multiple standards, those standards align with one another to ensure there is no contradiction in requirements.

There might be good reasons why any particular TRE does not possess one or more of the capabilities listed in this specification, but most TREs should aspire to meet them in the long-term.
