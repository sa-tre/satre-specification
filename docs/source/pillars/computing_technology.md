## End user computing

_The ability of the TRE organisation to provide and manage devices, workspaces, interfaces and applications used by researchers to interact with underlying systems and data._

### User interface

_The interfaces used for interacting with the TRE management system and the TRE workspace._

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:name: tab-end-user-user-interface

* - Statement
  - Guidance
  - Importance
* - A TRE should be accessed via a user interface accessible using commonly available applications.
  - TREs which allow users to connect from their own devices should not require the installation of any bespoke TRE application on the user's device.
    In practice a web browser is the most common way to achieve this.
  - Recommended
* - A TRE workspace should provide an environment familiar to the users of the TRE.
  - This may be in the form of a virtual Windows or Linux desktops, web applications, or a terminal.
    The use of custom developed TRE-specific software should be avoided when widely used open-source alternatives already exist.
  - Recommended
* - A TRE should take accessibility for users with disabilities into account.
  - The restricted nature of TREs means many assistive tools such as screenreaders in a virtual desktop may not be allowed, but other options such as colour schemes, font sizes, and resizing user interface elements, should be supported.
  - Recommended
* - Copying out data via the system clipboard must be disabled.
  - A TRE user must not be able to copy sensitive data out of a workspace using the system clipboard.
    A TRE may allow user to paste text into a workspace.
  - Mandatory
```

### Software tools

_The tools used by researchers inside a TRE, such as programming languages, IDEs and desktop applications._

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:name: tab-end-user-software-tools

* - Statement
  - Guidance
  - Importance
* - A TRE must provide software applications that are relevant to working with the data in the TRE.
  - The tools provided will depend on the types of data in the TRE, and the expectations of users of the TRE.
    This may include programming languages such as Python and R, integrated development environments, Jupyter notebooks, office type applications such as word processors and spreadsheets, command line tools, etc.
    The set of tools should be reviewed regularly to ensure they are up to date.
  - Mandatory
* - A TRE should provide tools to encourage best-practice in reproducibly analysing data.
  - Reproducibility of analyses improves auditability and accountability of how data has been used, as well as being best-practice in research.
    This may include version control software, and tools for developing and running data analysis pipelines.
  - Recommended
* - A TRE may provide shared services that are accessible to users in the same project.
  - This may include shared file storage, databases, collaborative writing, and other web applications.
    This must only be shared amongst users within the same project.
  - Optional
* - A TRE may provide limited access to some software repositories
  - For example, a TRE may allow installation of packages from Python or R repositories, or provide an internal mirror with approved packages.
  - Optional
```

### Advanced or cluster computing

_The ability to run analyses requiring more compute resources, or more specialised hardware, than is present in the user's workspace._

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:name: tab-end-user-advanced-cluster-computing

* - Statement
  - Guidance
  - Importance
* - A TRE should be able to provide access to high performance computing or other scaleable compute resource if required by users.
  - If a TRE supports users conducting computationally intensive research it should provide access to dynamically scaleable compute or the equivalent.
    For example this may be in the form of a batch scheduler on a HPC cluster, or a dynamically created compute nodes on a cloud platform.
  - Recommended
* - A TRE should be able to provide access to accelerators such as GPUs if required by users.
  - GPUs and other accelerators are commonly used in machine learning and other computationally intensive research.
    TREs should make it clear to users whether GPUs and other resources are available whilst projects are being assessed.
  - Recommended
* - Segregation of users and data must be maintained when using non-standard compute.
  - High performance or specialist compute is often shared amongst multiple users.
    Users and data must remain segregated at all times.
    For example, when using physical compute resources all sensitive data must be securely wiped before another user is given access to that same node.
    In a cloud hosted TRE virtual machines should be destroyed and recreated.
  - Mandatory
```

### Databases

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:name: tab-end-user-databases

* - Statement
  - Guidance
  - Importance
* - A TRE may make data available to researchers using comonly used databases servers such as PostgreSQL, MSSQL, MongoDB, etc.
  - Databases must be secured and only accessible to users within the same project.
    If shared (multi-tenant) database servers are used database administrators must ensure the database server enforces segregation of users and databases.
  - Optional
```

## Infrastructure analytics

_The ability of the TRE organisation to record and analyse data about the usage of the TRE._

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:name: tab-end-user-infrastructure-analytics

* - Statement
  - Guidance
  - Importance
* - A TRE must record usage of the TRE.
  - This may include the number of users, number of projects, the amount of data stored, number of datasets, the number of workspaces, etc.
  - Mandatory
* - A TRE should record which datasets are accessed, and when
  - This helps auditability of how sensitive data has been used
  - Recommended
* - A TRE should record computational resource usage at the user or aggregate level
  - This is useful for optimising allocation of resources, and managing costs.
  - Recommended
```

## Network management

_The ability of the TRE organisation to administer and secure network infrastructure using applications, tools and processes._

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:name: tab-end-user-network-management

* - Statement
  - Guidance
  - Importance
* - Networks must be managed and controlled to protect information in systems and applications
  - Network infrastructure must prevent unauthorised access to resources on the network.
    This may include firewalls, network segmentation, and restricting connections to the network.
  - Mandatory
* - Networks must be continually monitored for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities
  - This may include regular vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing.
  - Mandatory
* - Connectivity between users in different projects, or with access to different datasets, must not be allowed.
  - Connectivity between users in the same project may be allowed, for example to support shared network services within the project.
  - Mandatory
* - Outbound connections to the internet must be blocked by default.
  - Limited outbound connectivity may be allowed for some services.
  - Mandatory
```

## Infrastructure lifecycle management

_The ability of the TRE organisation to manage necessary physical or virtual infrastructure._

### Deployment management

_The ability of the TRE organisation to instantiate, deploy, change or remove deployed infrastructure._

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:name: tab-deployment-management

* - Statement
  - Guidance
  - Importance
* - You must have a documented procedure for deploying infrastructure.
  - This might, for instance, be a handbook that is followed or a set of automated scripts.
  - Mandatory
* - Where possible, you should automate any repeatable aspects of your deployment.
  - This might involve using infrastructure-as-code tools or simply a series of scripts.
  - Recommended
* - You must have a documented procedure for making changes to deployed infrastructure.
  - This refers both to changes that might be expected in the course of normal operation and emergency changes that might be needed.
    Your change management process may form part of a wider accreditation such as ISO 27001.
  - Mandatory
* - You must test changes before they are used in production.
  - This might involve a separate development environment or another system for testing.
  - Mandatory
* - You could test changes in a development environment that mirrors your production system.
  - Consider the costs and practicality of whether this will work for your situation.
  - Optional
* - You must have a documented procedure for removing infrastructure when it is no longer needed
  - Removing unused infrastructure not only reduces costs and management burden but also reduces the attack surface of a TRE and reduces the risk of unaddressed vulnerabilities.
  - Mandatory
```

### Capacity management

_The ability of the TRE organisation to ensure the right amount of resources are available at the right time to provide a service._

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:name: tab-capacity-management

* - Statement
  - Guidance
  - Importance
* - You must ensure that all projects understand what resources are available and what the associated costs will be before the project starts.
  - For on-premises systems this might be related to the available hardware, for cloud-based systems there might be limits on how many instances of a particular resource (_e.g._ GPUs) can be used. Projects should use this information to understand whether the available resources will be sufficient for their requirements.
  - Mandatory
* - You should ensure that the anticipated needs of projects can be satisfied using available resources.
  - Note that this does not require you to accept requests for additional resources, but rather that promises made about resource availability before a project starts should be honoured wherever possible.
  - Recommended
* - You must ensure that the anticipated resource requirements will not result in overspending by the TRE.
  - For cloud-based TREs this may involve budgeting and/or restricting resource consumption on a project-by-project basis.
    For on-premises TREs this may involve managing expectations to match the available resource.
  - Mandatory
* - You must have a procedure for increasing/decreasing available resources.
  - For cloud-based TREs this may involve scaling resources, such as virtual machines or databases, or deploying additional resources.
    For on-premises TREs this may involve a procurement process to ensure that necessary resources are available.
  - Mandatory
* - You must have a procedure to decide when to change capacity.
  - Not all requests for capacity increase must necessarily be granted, but having a clear process will help projects understand when/why/how they can make use of additional capacity.
  - Mandatory
```

### Configuration management

_The ability of the TRE organisation to identify, maintain, and verify information on IT assets and configurations in the TRE organisation._

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:name: tab-configuration-management

* - Statement
  - Guidance
  - Importance
* - You must have a documented procedure for configuring infrastructure.
  - This might, for instance, be a handbook that is followed or a set of automated scripts.
  - Mandatory
* - You should use configuration management tools to automate application of your configuration wherever possible.
  - This might involve configuration-as-code tools such as Ansible, Chef, Puppet or Windows Desired State Configuration or simply automated scripts.
  - Recommended
* - You should be able to verify whether the configuration is valid.
  - This might, for instance, involve running your configuration management tool in 'check' mode.
  - Recommended
* - You should, if possible, regularly verify your TRE configuration.
  - This will limit the amount of time the TRE can spend in a non-compliant state.
  - Mandatory
* - You must be able to replace a non-compliant TRE with a compliant system.
  - This might involve reconfiguring a running system or by replacing it with a compliant one.
  - Mandatory
```

## Availability management

_The ability of the TRE organisation to ensure all IT infrastructure, processes, tools, roles etc are appropriate for the agreed availability targets._

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:name: tab-availability-management

* - Statement
  - Guidance
  - Importance
* - You should understand the availability and uptime guarantees of any providers that you rely on.
  - For remote TREs this might include your cloud provider(s) and/or data centre operators.
    For on-premises TREs, it might be worth considering your ISP and electricity provider.
  - Recommended
* - You should develop an availability target or statement and share this with your users.
  - Understanding how and when the TRE might be unavailable will help your projects in planning their work.
  - Recommended
```
