## What is SATRE?

SATRE (Standard Architecture for Trusted Research Environments) is the UK's first open, community-led specification for Trusted Research Environments (TREs). Developed through extensive collaboration with over 60 organizations and informed by public engagement, SATRE provides a comprehensive framework for building, operating, and evaluating TREs across academia, healthcare, industry, and government.

TREs are secure computing environments specifically designed for research using sensitive or personal data. They enable researchers to access and analyze data safely while minimizing the risk of data exposure or release. SATRE brings consistency and best practice to how these environments are designed, operated, and governed.

## Why SATRE Matters

Personal and sensitive data collected for operational, commercial, or governmental purposes hold immense value for research that benefits society. However, accessing this data requires robust security, governance, and ethical frameworks. Without standardization, TREs across the UK have developed independently, leading to:

- Inconsistent governance standards and security approaches
- Difficulty for researchers working across multiple TREs
- Challenges for data owners in understanding and trusting TRE operations
- Barriers to collaboration and data sharing between institutions
- Duplication of effort in developing TRE capabilities

## The SATRE Specification

The SATRE specification is built on four guiding principles: **Usability, Maintaining Public Trust, Observability, and Standardisation.** These principles ensure that TREs are not only secure and compliant but also accessible to researchers and trustworthy to the public.


### Four Pillars of SATRE

**1. Information Governance**
Quality management, risk management, training delivery, member accreditation, and governance procedures that ensure TREs operate safely and ethically.
**2. Computing Technology**
End-user computing experience, infrastructure management, information security, and configuration management for secure data analysis environments.
**3. Data Management**
Data lifecycle management, identity and access management, output management, information discovery, and research metadata capabilities.
**4. Supporting Capabilities**
Financial management, public engagement and involvement, project management, procurement, and other essential operational functions.

## Public Trust at the Core

SATRE embeds public involvement and engagement throughout its development and within the specification itself. Through workshops with members of the public, we identified that cybersecurity, oversight, transparency, and public involvement were essential for maintaining trust in TREs.

**Public Voice in Action**
Two public members served on the core SATRE project team from the beginning, ensuring public perspectives shaped all work packages. Public workshop feedback directly led to:

- Upgrading Public Involvement and Engagement statements from Optional to Mandatory* for TREs using personal data
- Including requirements for TREs to publicly report on incidents and near-misses
- Adding detailed specifications on transparency and public-facing information
- Strengthening oversight and governance requirements
