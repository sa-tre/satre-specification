# The Architecture

This Standard Architecture for Trusted Research Environments (TREs) provides a comprehensive high-level architecture for research organisations handling sensitive data safely.
The architecture is documented using the [ArchiMate](https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/archimate3-doc/) modelling language with models created using the open source modelling tool [Archi](https://www.archimatetool.com/).

Capabilities an organisation requires to run a TRE are documented and deconstructed to show the elements (Roles, processes, applications and data) needed to realise those capabilities.
Views are provided aligned to the capabilities and additional views show alignment external frameworks such as the [Five Safes](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/help/secure-lab/what-is-the-five-safes-framework/).

The current version of the architecture is available for download in the [Architecture Repository](https://github.com/sa-tre/satre-archimate).

The architecture and SATRE standard maps to the architecture meta-model below.
